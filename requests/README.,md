# Requests 
Typically the requests module is used with json as well..
When working with an API you will typically need a token ID/api key for authentication 
Once you get that, you will need to run a get request to get an ID of something..

Here is an example from pagerduty:
```
import requests

url = "https://api.pagerduty.com/incidents"

querystring = {"user_ids[]":"UIDHERE"}

headers = {
    'accept': "application/vnd.pagerduty+json;version=2",
    'authorization': "Token token=y_NbAkKc66ryYTWUXYEu"
    }

response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers, params=querystring)

print(response.text)
```

Once ran, you will get fields/payloads for example:
```
{
  "incident": {
    "title": "Your desk is on fire!",
    "service": {
      "id": "PW7YESS",
      "type": "service_reference"
    },
    "assignments": [
      {
        "assignee": {
          "id": "PZUVZZZ",
          "type": "user_reference"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

1. Now let's say you only want to print out the payload of the id under incident? How would you do that?
1. Now let's run this in a loop- Let's say you have several incidents.. Not just one in this case, how would you grab each id of every incident?
1. Once you have the ID of each incident you want to use it for another GET request
1. Let's say you want to query a GET request for every ID to https://api.pagerduty.com/incidents/{id}/log_entries
1. From each of those payloads you want to search for the string "Restart" in the summary section 
1. If the string "Restart" is in the payload, then run a script that prints "Horray!!"
